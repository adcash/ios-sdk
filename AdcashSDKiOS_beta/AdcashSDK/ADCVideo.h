 @brief Sent when the app is about to enter in background because user

 Method `applicationDidEnterBackground:` of your app delegate is called immediately after this.
 
 @note The method is called before calling `[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:]`.
 Therefore, the application will not enter in background if `openURL:` does not succeed.
 Do not rely on the assumption that `videoWillLeaveApplication:` will always be followed by
 entering the application in background mode.

 Class to display a Video Ad.
 Videos are full screen advertisements that are shown at natural transition
 points in your application such as between game levels, when switching news stories,
 in general when transitioning from one view controller to another. It's best to request
 for an video some time before when it's actually needed, so it can preload it's content and 
 become ready to present, and when the time comes, it can be immediately presented to the user
 with a smooth expericence.
